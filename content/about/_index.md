Hi :wave:

### Profile

I'm an up & coming developer who loves learning how to build things and how they work. I have experience coding in the .Net Framework including ASP.Net Core to build desktop applications as well as websites. Furthermore, I have experience in database design and administration with various databases using SQL. I have some experience in Python writing miscellaneous scripts and currently learning & exploring programming electronics with Python. 

Alongside programming, I have extensive experience providing technical support ranging from software to hardware. I've helped install, configure, and repair various software issues for organizations and individuals. I've also built many PC's as well as replace many hardware components for PC's and mobile phones.
