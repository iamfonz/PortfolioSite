For the final project of the C++ II course at [CNM](https://www.cnm.edu/), we had to build a spin-off of the [Enigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) encryption machine. It wasn't exactly like the original, rather somewhat inspired. 

The user selects a key or chooses to have one selected randomly. Next, the user selects the encoding scheme they wish to use. Lastly, they type in the message they wish to encode. Once encoded, the encoded message is saved to a text file with all of the details needed to decode it.

The program also has the feature of decoding a message. The key and encoding scheme must be known for it decode. It takes in a text file for this function to work.

I'm particularly proud of this little project because at the time it was a great challenge for me. I learned a lot and felt accomplished when turning it in. It was also cool to share it with classmates and see their work as well.
