For the final project of the C++ II course at [CNM](https://www.cnm.edu/), we had to build a spin-off of the [Enigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) encryption machine. It wasn't exactly like the original, rather somewhat inspired. 

The user selects an encoding scheme and types a message to be encrypted.
