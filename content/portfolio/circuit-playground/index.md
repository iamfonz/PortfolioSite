The COVID-19 pandemic caused me to be laid off. In turn, I gained a lot of free time. I've spent a majority of it working on various house projects for the home I bought in late February 2020. I've also set aside time to do some coding and learn new skills. I was fortunate enough to be awarded 3 months of a Codecademy PRO subscription. I started with a SQL course to keep my skills up to date. Along the way, I decided to start the [Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython) course.

For some time, I've wanted to build a plant care device. When I looked over the syllabus of the course and noticed a plant care section, I knew I had to enroll. I bought 
the required supplies and patiently waited for them to arrive. 

The first half of the course covers the very basics of using the Circuit Playground Express such as lighting LEDs, clicking the buttons, and implementing a switch. Then, the first project is coding a bike light. I wrote my own bike-light that I think is cool. All in all this has been a fun project to work on.

I'm still working on this course and taking my time with it as I want to make sure I truly understand everything rather than just complete the course. This page will get updated as more work gets done it.
