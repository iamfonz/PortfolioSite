When I started working for my previous employer, Shoe Box, in 2012, inventory was taken the old fashioned way; with pen and paper. Of course, this old method is prone to many errors. As time went by, I gained a lot of trust and respect from my supervisors and colleagues by taking initiative on various tasks and responsibilities. I knew there had to be a better way of doing inventory. 

And so, my quest to overhaul the inventory process started around 2014. I didn't have any programming skills when I started this venture. Though, I had more than enough Excel and PC skills to rig something together. It started out as filling in an Excel worksheet with Sku and Quantity pairs. While it was a bit faster than pen and paper, it still wasn't quite cutting it.

One day when I was repairing a colleague's PC, I found an old USB barcode scanner in the network room. I was ecstatic becayse I knew scanning barcodes was going to be much faster and easier. But I still had a hurdle to overcome. I needed a way to match the barcode values with Sku values.
