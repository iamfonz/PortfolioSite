### Overview
As a computer geek, I love having fast network speeds. There's nothing more satisfying than seeing blazing fast downloads/uploads and transfer speeds between systems. While Wi-Fi gets the job done, a wired connection is king. And that is where my latest project has become building out a home network.

I ran CAT6 and RG6 cabling throughout my house. I routed all of the cabling up into my attic and have them drop into my office where all of the network gear is housed. The CAT6 is punched down to keystones in a patch panel. The RG6 is terminted into a separate patch panel connected to an amplifier that will supply an over-the-air tv antenna signal.
