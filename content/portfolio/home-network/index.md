### Overview
As a computer geek, I love having fast network speeds. There's nothing more satisfying than seeing blazing fast downloads/uploads and transfer speeds between systems. While Wi-Fi gets the job done, there's nothing like having a wired connection. And that is where my latest project has become building out a home network.

I'm running CAT6 and RG6 cabling throughout my house. I'm routing all of the cabling up into my attic and having them drop into an office room of the house where all of the network gear will be housed. The CAT6 will be punched down and added to a patch panel. The RG6 will be terminted into an amplifier that will supply an over-the-air tv antenna signal. 

As for the network gear, I will be building out my own router/firewall using an Optiplex 7040 SFF running an i5 with 8 GB RAM and a quad gigabit network card running [OpnSense](https://opnsense.org/). I have a 24-port managed switch that will supply connectivity to all of the runs throughout. Lastly, I'll be adding a POE switch to connect access points for Wi-Fi connectivity.

I'll be updating this page as I make progress. Pictures will be coming soon, I Promise!
