Metal-O-Matic was inspired by an old web game I played when I was younger. It's a music game where the user gets to arrange different sound clips for three different instruments to produce music. As my final project for a Javascript class, I decided to try my own crack at it. But with a metal twist on it.

To make the sound clips, I recorded all the guitar parts and used a drum machine. I used Bootstrap 3 to quickly style the page and make it responsive. I also used some custom CSS to style the page and create the animations for the band members.

All in all, I was happy with the outcome. It took me back to the good 'ol simple days. Though, there are some improvements I'd like to make at some point. I think it would be cool to add the ability to change clips on the fly rather than have to stop the music then play it again. I also think it would be awesome to be able to drag and drop sound clips on a timeline to make a more extensive and complex song, just like the original game that inspired this all, Punk-O-Matic. Check it out below.
